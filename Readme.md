## Author's note

Except for the mentioned links, there is not much information about the 
network language, nor can you find many examples on the Internet, and 
the few communities or forums that are found seem to be strangely 
abandoned or with little participation. I hope this example is useful 
for anyone who wants to venture into this strange and powerful language.
